Basic Usage
The interface to Artifice is fairly self-explanatory, but to get started,
you can add and remove cards to and from a set by clicking the + and - buttons
below the set view table in the upper right section of the editor window.

Edits to a card's data will be applied to the card when you deselect the field
being edited; this will also cause the card to be re-rendered.

When adding art to your card design, you currently have to crop it to the
appropriate aspect ratio in the image editing application of your choice.
Each template requires a different aspect ratio:

 - The standard template requires a ratio of 4:3 (e.g. 400x300, 800x600, etc)
 - The token template without rules text requires a ratio of
   4:4.6 (e.g. 400x460, 1200x1380, etc)
 - The token template with rules text requires a ratio of 4:3.5 (e.g.
   400x350, 800x700, etc.)

Any image resolution is acceptable, so long as the aspect ratio is correct.
Obviously, the higher your image quality, the better the card will look, but
you probably already know that!

The usual save/open menu items are available; card art is preserved in the saved
set file, so no other files are necessary to share your set with other users.
Additionally, you can export a card to a print-quality PDF from the File menu;
for now, exporting to PNG must be done from within Preview or the other
application of your choice, but selectable-resolution PNG export is on the
list of features to be added in future versions of Artifice, along with
exporting an entire set in one go.

The three tabs of the editor each serve a different function: the "Card Info"
tab is for editing data for individual cards that almost all cards will need;
the "Card Extras" tab contains card-specific information that is less commonly
used; and the "Set Info" tab lets you edit information about the set as a whole.
